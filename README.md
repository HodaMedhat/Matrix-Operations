# Matrix-Operations

this project was made in 2019 for an assigned project in my 2nd year in electricl depatrmant , Faculty of engineering , Ain Shams University.

the program uses the defind string format in both input and output.
the string representation of the matrix is : [-2 10.2;0 33.44]
the program has multiple operations as follows: 
* (+) for Adding
* (-) for Subtracting
* (*) for multiplying
* / for Division
* ^ for Power
* T for Transpose
* I for Inverse
* D for Determinant 
the project has two parts real part and bouns complex part:
### real-matrix 
this file includes my code for :
* converting the string matrix to an array with real numbers  
* applying add,subtract,division and multiply operation to two matrices with real numbers
* getting power,inverse,transopse and determinant for a matrix 

### complex-matrix
this file includes my code for:
* making a complex class that takes real and imaganary parts and can add , subtract and mutilply complex numbers
* converting the string matrix to an array with complex numbers
* applying add,subtract and multiply operation to two matrices with complex numbers
